I used PTRACE_SYSCALL to stop before the next syscall (it's stop also after the syscall) and I checked if regs.orig_eax == 3, if it's 3 then it's read syscall.
If it's read syscall I wanted that the read will fail. So, I puted 0 in edx, which is the register that save number of bytes to read.
This will cause every file to look empty to the antivirus.
