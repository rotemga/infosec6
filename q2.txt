In q2.c file:
I found the dynamic address of check_if_virus with the gdb.
I created a new function that doing this code: "MOV EAX,0;RET;" (This function return alyaws 0)
I used ptrace to put the new function code in the address of check_if_virus.

In q2.py file:
I replaced all "0x12345678" in the data in q2.template with the pid of the antivirus process.
